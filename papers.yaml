      We comprehensively characterize escape, breadth, and potency across a panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 
      targeting the receptor binding domain, including the parent antibody of the recently approved Vir 
      antibody drug (Sotrovimab), illuminating escape mutations with structural and dynamic insight into 
      their mechanism of action.

      Here, we characterize the biophysical mechanisms underlying mutants of Abl kinase associated with clinical
      drug resistance to targeted cancer therapies. We uncover a surprising novel mechanism of mutational 
      resistance to kinase inhibitor therapy in which the off-rate for inhibitor unbinding is increased 
      without affecting inhibitor affinity.

      The SAMPL6 pKa challenge assessed the ability of the computational chemistry community to predict macroscopic 
      and microscopic pKas for a set of druglike molecules resembling kinase inhibitors. This paper reports on the 
      overall performance and lessons learned, including the surprising finding that many tools predict reasonably 
      accurate macroscopic pKas corresponding to the wrong microscopic protonation sites.

    description: >
      New mutations that enhance the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for human ACE2—and potentially pose threats to 
      antibody-based therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19—are already emerging in the wild. We characterize and describe
      sentinel mutations of SARS-CoV-2 in the wild that herald challenges for combatting COVID-19, and use simulations of 
      the RBD-ACE2 interface on Folding@home to biophysically characterize why these mutations can lead to enhanced affinity.

      describes the current community consensus in how to curate experimental benchmark data for 
      assessing predictive affinity models for drug discovery, how to prepare these systems for 
      affinity calculations, and how to assess the results to compare performance.

      In this first use of hybrid machine learning / molecular mechanics (ML/MM) potentials
      for alchemical free energy calculations, we demonstrate how the improved modeling of
      intramolecular ligand energetics offered by the quantum machine learning potential
      ANI-2x can significantly improve the accuracy in predicting kinase inhibitor binding
      free energy by reducing the error from 0.97~kcal/mol to 0.47~kcal/mol, which could
      drastically reduce the number of compounds that must be synthesized in lead
      optimization campaigns for minimal additional computational cost.

      We asked whether the similarity of binding sites in related kinases might result
      in a fortuitous cancellation of errors in using alchemical free energy calculations
      to predict kinase inhibitor selectivities. Surprisingly, we find that even distantly
      related kinases have sufficient correlation in their errors that predicting changes in selectivity
      can be much more accurate than predicting changes in potency due to this effect, and
      show how this could lead to large reductions in the number of molecules that must
      be synthesized to achieve a desired selectivity goal.

      To accelerate a multitude of drug development activities to combat the global threat posed by COVID-19,
      over a million citizen scientists have banded together through the Folding@home distributed computing
      project to create the world’s first Exascale computer and simulate protein dynamics. An unprecedented
      0.1 seconds of simulation of the viral proteome reveal how the spike complex uses conformational masking
      to evade an immune response, conformational changes implicated in the function of other viral proteins,
      and cryptic pockets that are absent in experimental structures. These structures and mechanistic insights
      present new targets for the design of therapeutics.

      The COVID-19 pandemic has left the world scrambling to find effective therapies
      to stem the tidal wave of death and put an end to the worldwide disruption
      caused by SARS-CoV-2. In this Correspondence, we argue for the need for a new open,
      collaborative drug discovery model (exemplified by our COVID Moonshot collaboration)
      that breaks free of the limitations of industry-led competitive drug discovery efforts
      that necessarily restrict information flow and hinder rapid progress by prioritizing
      profits and patent protection over human lives.

     Here, we demonstrate how the physical nature of protonation and tautomeric state effects
     means that the standard state free energies of each microscopic protonation/tautomeric
     state at a single pH is sufficient to describe the complete pH-dependent microscopic
     and macroscopic populations. We introduce a new kind of diagram that uses this concept
     to illustrate a variety of pH-dependent phenomena, and show how it can be used to identify
     common issues with protonation state prediction algorithms. As a result, we recommend
     future blind prediction challenges utilize microstate free energies at a single reference
     pH as the minimal sufficient information for assessing prediction accuracy and utility.

      To assess the relative efficiencies of alchemical binding free energy calculations,
      the SAMPL6 SAMPLing challenge asked participants to submit predictions as a function of
      computer effort for the same force field and charge model. Surprisingly, we found that
      most molecular simulation codes cannot agree on the binding free energy was, even for
      the same force field.

       Graph convolutional and message-passing networks can be a powerful tool for predicting physical properties of
       small molecules when coupled to a simple physical model that encodes the relevant invariances. Here, we show
       the ability of graph nets to rapidly predict high-quality partial atomic charges of small drug-like molecules
       for use in molecular dynamics simulations, physical docking calculations, and alchemical free energy calculations
       for computing affinity and selectivity to various target proteins.

     To understand how kinase regulation by phosphorylation emerged, we reconstruct the common ancestor of CDKs and
     MAPKs, using biochemical experiments and massively parallel molecular simulations to study how a few mutations
     were sufficient to switch ERK-family kinases from high- to low-autophosphorylation.

     We have recently developed the SMIRNOFF99Frosst 1.0.5 small molecule force field, a compact, minimalistic
     general small molecule force field intended for accurately modeling the interactions of small molecules with
     receptors. Here, we assess the ability of this force field to accurately reproduce the binding thermodynamics
     of host-guest systems featuring druglike small molecules, where high-quality calorimetric data is readily available.
     We show that SMIRNOFF99Frosst peforms well in comparison with the older GAFF force fields, despite having 20x
     fewer parameters.

      In this work, we show how targeted X-ray crystallography using covalent inhibitors and depletion of
      native ligands to reveal structures of low-population hidden conformations can be combined with
      massively distributed molecular simulation to resolve the functional dynamic landscape of the protein
      methyltransferase SETD8 in unprecedented atomistic detail. Using an aggregate of six milliseconds of
      fully atomistic simulation from Folding@home, we use a new approach to constructing Markov state models
      of conformational dynamics to to illuminate the conformations corresponding energetics for this important epigenetic protein.
      All Folding@home simulation trajectories for this paper are available on the Open Science Framework.
      The trajectories generated for this project were used as the source for a unique musical composition 'Metastable'
      by George Holloway, performed by the Ligeti String Quartet with visual accompaniment from Robert Arbon.

      physical modeling approaches were able to predict ligand binding affinities for simple
      ligand recognition problems where receptor sampling and protonation state effects are
      eliminated due to the simplicity of supramolecular hosts. We find that progress is
      now stagnated likely due to force field limitations.

      developed by Markus Seeliger (now at Stony Brook) to develop a library of human kinase
      catalytic domains for facile and inexpensive expression in bacteria.

     In our first collaborative paper with Schrödinger, we present the first comprehensive benchmark
     assessing the ability for alchemical free energy calculations to predict clinical mutational
     resistance or susceptibility to targeted kinase inhibitors using the well-studied kinase Abl,
     the target of therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

    description: >
     Molecular dynamics simulations necessarily use a finite timestep, which introduces error
     or bias in the sampled configuration space density that grows rapidly with increasing timestep.
     For the first time, we show how to compute a natural measure of this error---the KL
     divergence---in both phase and configuration space for a widely used family of Langevin
     integrators, and show that VRORV is generally superior for simulation of molecular systems.

     Solicited manuscript for special issue of the Journal of Computer Aided Molecular Design on
     the SAMPL5 Challenge.
     The SAMPL Challenges have driven predictive physical modeling for ligand:protein binding
     forward by focusing the community on a series of blind challenges that evaluate performance
     on blind datasets, focus attention on current challenges for physical modeling techniques,
     and provide high-quality experimental datasets to the community after the challenge is over.
     For many years, challenges focused around hydration free energies have proven to be extremely
     useful, with theory now able to determine when experiment is wrong. To replace these challenges,
     since no more hydration free energy data is being measured, we proposed to use the partition or
     distribution coefficients of small druglike molecules between aqueous and apolar phases. We
     report the collection of cyclohexane-water partition data for a set of compounds used to
     drive the SAMPL5 distribution coefficient challenge, providing the experimental data,
     methodology, and insight for future iterations of this challenge.

     simple idea can help explain a large amount of the discrepancy in this assay, and provide
     simple mathematical tools and an IPython notebook illustrating how easy it is to model the
     error and bias in experimental assays even when other information about assay reliability
     is unavailable.

     Progress in forcefield validation and parameterization has been hindered by the availability

     how the NIST ThermoML dataset provides a solution to this problem, and demonstrate its utility
     in benchmarking the GAFF/AM1-BCC small molecule forcefield on neat liquid densities and static
     dielectric constants to uncover problems in the representation of low-dielectric environments.

     Machine learning encompasses a set of tools and algorithms which are now becoming popular in almost
     all scientific and technological fields. This is true for molecular dynamics as well, where machine
     learning offers promises of extracting valuable information from the enormous amounts of data
     generated by simulation of complex systems. We provide here a review of our current understanding
     of goals, benefits, and limitations of machine learning techniques for computational studies on
     atomistic systems, focusing on the construction of empirical force fields from ab-initio
     databases and the determination of reaction coordinates for free energy computation and enhanced
     sampling.

     Ensemble docking corresponds to the generation of an “ensemble” of drug target conformations
     in computational structure-based drug discovery, often obtained by using molecular dynamics
     simulation, that is used in docking candidate ligands. This approach is now well established
     in the field of early-stage drug discovery. This review gives a historical account of the
     development of ensemble docking and discusses some pertinent methodological advances in
     conformational sampling.

     The Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) series of blind prediction
     challenges provide unbiased, prospective tests of computational methods, serving as a crowdsourcing
     mechanism to drive innovation. These challenges solicit submissions from the computational community to
     predict properties of interest, such as solvation, partition, or binding of drug-like molecules.
     These challenges provided substantial benefit to the community, and have led to roughly 100 publications,
     many of which are broadly cited (see attached bibliography). We are currently seeking funding from the
     NIH and surveyed the community concerning experiences with SAMPL and how our future plans for SAMPL
     can best align with the community’s interests and needs. This document summarizes the results of
     this survey and describes our findings. On the whole, the community enthusiastically supports our
     plans for the future of SAMPL, and provided modest suggestions to further strengthen our plans.

     Markov models provide a useful simplified representation for characterizing the long-time statistical
     evolution of biomolecules in a manner that allows direct comparison with experiments as well as the
     elucidation of mechanistic pathways for an inherently stochastic process. A vital part of meaningful
     comparison with experiment is the characterization of the statistical uncertainty in the predicted
     experimental measurement, which may take the form of an equilibrium measurement of some spectroscopic
     signal, the time-evolution of this signal following a perturbation, or the observation of some statistic
     such as the correlation function of the equilibrium dynamics of a single molecule. Without meaningful
     error bars which arise from both approximation and statistical error, there is no way to determine
     whether the deviations between model and experiment are statistically meaningful. In this chapter,
     we describe …

     In order to simulate Langevin dynamics on a digital computer it is necessary to adopt some approximate
     algorithm that divides time into discrete steps. 2 However, such schemes have an inherent problem: even
     with a time-independent Hamiltonian, they do not preserve the canonical equilibrium distribution, nor
     are they microscopically reversible (since trajectories and their timereversal do not have the same
     probability), but instead simulate a driven nonequilibrium dynamics. Happily, the complications
     generated by this unwanted but inevitable breaking of time-reversal symmetry can be remedied3–6 with
     insights from nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics, and by adopting an integration scheme in which
     the breaking of time-reversal symmetry can be isolated and measured.

     Improved rational drug design methods are needed to lower the cost and increase the success rate of drug
     discovery and development. Alchemical binding free energy calculations, one potential tool for rational
     design, have progressed rapidly over the past decade, but still fall short of providing robust tools for
     pharmaceutical engineering. Recent studies, especially on model receptor systems, have clarified many of
     the challenges that must be overcome for robust predictions of binding affinity to be useful in rational
     design. In this review, inspired by a recent joint academic/industry meeting organized by the authors,
     we discuss these challenges and suggest a number of promising approaches for overcoming them.

     This dissertation is concerned with the construction, validation, and use of master equation models
     for the study of macromolecular conformational dynamics. The master equation formalism is a powerful
     tool for describing the dynamics of a system that can be characterized by a discrete-state,
     continuous-time Markov process. Once constructed from a large quantities of short trajectories,
     the evolution of experimentally measurable dynamical observables can be computed and compared
     with experiment. Additionally, information not yet directly accessible to experiment but which
     may be useful in aiding understanding or the generation of novel hypotheses, such as folding
     pathways, transiently populated conformations, and mean first passage times, can also be easily
     obtained. We demonstrate that a master equation model constructed from short trajectories can
     describe slow conformational dynamics for a solvated alanine peptide over long times,
     propose a number of tests to tell whether a model constructed from short trajectories will
     adequately describe dynamics over long times, and describe an algorithm for the automatic construction
     of these models from simulation data. While the focus here is on protein folding and dynamics,
     these techniques are very general, and can be broadly applied to problems in biomolecular dynamics.

     This technical report outlines the requirements of a system for the execution and analysis of parallel
     molecular dynamics simulations that allows the easy implementation of efficient modern simulation
     algorithms for computing thermodynamic and kinetic quantities with classical molecular dynamics.
     Some notes on a possible design for such a system are also included as a first step toward the
     construction a generally useful system for the biomolecular simulation community.

     We demonstrate the long-time dynamics of a simple solvated peptide (terminally-blocked alanine) can
     described by a discrete-state, continuous-time master equation model constructed from molecular
     dynamics simulation data. Manual division of phase space into six states yields Markovian dynamics
     in this reduced state space.

     Here, we show how the discrete-state, continuous-time memoryless (Markovian) master equation can
     be obtained from classical statistical mechanics. Our purpose is to (1) justify that the master
     equation can provide a good description of long-time dynamics provided certain conditions are met,
     (2) determine the necessary set of conditions that must be met and the minimum coarse-grained time
     over which the dynamics is accurate,(3) gain insight as to how to construct efficient algorithms for
     state decomposition to minimize the time for emergence of Markovian behavior, and (4) expose
     alternative expressions for the inter-state transition rates that may provide more efficient routes
     to their estimation by computer simulation.
